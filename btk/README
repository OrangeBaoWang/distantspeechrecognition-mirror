                          Installation Instructions


 1. Required components

To install the 'btk' module, you will need the following components,
all of which are available with all major Linux releases (e.g., SuSE 9.2):

  python - scripting language interpretter
  numerical python - Matlab like extension to python
  gsl - GNU Scientific Library
  swig - simplified wrapper and interface generator
  autoconf - automatic project configuration
  pkgconf - automatic project configuration

The following dependencies are optional. If they are installed on your
machine, 'autoconf' will find them, then compile and link against them.

  atlas - blas implementation for linux
  fftw3 - optimized fft computation

  setenv PKG_CONFIG_PATH /home/<user-name>/lib/pkgconfig


2. Getting 'btk'

To get 'btk' for the first time, type

  cd ~/src
  svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/distantspeechrecognition/code/ distantspeechrecognition-code
  cd trunk/btk

If you have an existing working directory that you would like to update, type

  cd ~/src/btk
  svn update .


 3. Configuration

If you wish to install 'btk' in the global space on a given workstation, type

  cd ~/src/btk
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure

If you would like to install 'btk' in some local directory, type for example

  cd ~/src/btk
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure --prefix=/home/<user-name> CFLAGS='-O4' CXXFLAGS='-O4' CPPFLAGS='-O4' SWIGFLAGS='-O'

where <user-name> is your login id. You need only run the script
'autogen.sh' once.

If you want to use the 'atlas' blas library, configure with

  ./configure --with-atlas=<path-to-atlas>


 4. Building and Installing

To build and install 'btk', type

  cd ~/src/btk
  make
  make install


 5. Adjusting your environment

In order for Python to be able to find and dynamically link the 'btk'
module, it must be on your PYTHONPATH. If you have installed 'btk'
locally as described above and you are using 'bash', add the
line
  
  export PYTHONPATH=/home/<user-name>/lib/python2.6/site-packages:/usr/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages:/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages

to your .bashrc file. If you are using 'tcsh', add the line

  setenv PYTHONPATH /home/jmcd/lib/python2.6/site-packages:/usr/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages:/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages

to your .tcshrc file.


 6. Testing

To test that everything has been built and installed correctly, start
the Python interpretter and type

  >>> import btk.modulated

If you get another Python prompt, everything has worked correctly.
